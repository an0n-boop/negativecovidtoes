## A Detailed Case of Negative COVID Toes
This document summarizes an extensive case history of my encounter with COVID toes. 

Twelve days after a visit to a crowded grocery store I began to develop COVID toes. Later testing, both PCR and antibody, would come back negative.

### Contents & Goals
*Disclaimer: this document is not medical advice. Go see a doctor.*

This document offers *description*, *interpretation*, and *extensive data* (timeline, test results, photos). 

**Primary Goal: Useful Data** - present a detailed case history of negative COVID toes for the medical community to study, in order to help more patients.

**Secondary Goal: Inform other Patients** - directly help other sick people who may have similar symptoms to me gain knowledge about what my experience was like (again, *go see your doctor*, but now with more information).

### Contents
After a description of my disease I offer some hypotheses and my interpretation, and conclude with extensive data (timeline, test results, photos). 

While this is just one data point, my hope is its exhaustive quality offers some leads helpful to the medical community.

### Narrative
I'm an American man in my early 30s of Indian (South Asian) descent, living in a warm climate. Twelve days after a last-minute run to my local grocery store on the day our shelter in place order was issued (very crowded, impossible to enforce social distancing in long checkout line), my toes swelled up and my feet (including soles, heels) became painful to walk or stand on.

My toes would swell more at night, with the feet becoming unbearably painful, itchy, and hot to the touch. My feet are typically very cold (causes my wife to yelp in bed etc.). During these night attacks, elevation, miconazole (antifungal spray), and painkillers (tylenol, advil) were ineffective. Ice packs helped a bit. Extremely cold water epsom salt baths were the only thing that brought relief.

As I observed it, my disease progressed through several phases.

**Phase 1: Ramp Up** (weeks 1-2 of symptoms)

Toes swell up a lot (almost 2x in size), get very red, painful to stand on, cannot go for walks outside. Not all toes are affected, nor are all the effected toes equally severe. Night attacks start. I think it's athlete's foot and try miconazole, but no effect. First few doctors think it's friction blisters or contact dermatitis. I trace my swelling outline with ballpoint pen to rule out cellulitis.

**Phase 2: Development** (weeks 3-4 of symptoms)

I've begun triamcinalone 0.1% ointment at 2x/day. Color of toes shifts towards purple. Soreness/tenderness begins to decrease and it's a bit easier to stand and walk inside. Purple spots appear: first faint and then darken in color and intensify as rest of affected area gets less red. For the first time since night attacks began, get two nights in a row without a cold water bath. Eventually itchiness in night attacks migrates to heels and soles, no longer in the toes. I eventually shift to Clobetasol from triamcinalone.

**Phase 3: Recovery** (weeks 5-7+ of symptoms, ongoing)

I'm free of night attacks and stop Clobetasol, but that brings them back, so I restart. By now I'm on Clobetasol 2x/day, Aspirin 325mg 1x/day. Blisters have formed over the purple spots, becoming hard and then flaking off. The more involved toes take longer to blister and peel than the others. Toes go first, then the spots on heels. I can walk outside in tennis shoes, but get swollen, painful feet after ~30min of walking. Gradually this is improving. Blisters are still peeling.

### Patient Background
No family history of lupus or other autoimmune disorders, on either side. I'm physically very active, going to the gym 5x/week pre-shutdown, and during the shutdown working out at home (pushups, squats) while running or walking (1hr+) everyday. I take a multivitamin daily.

### Pain
I experienced several types of pain in my feet (toes, heels, soles) during this disease:
* in general, toes hurt more than my heels, which hurt more than my soles
* pain and symptoms would migrate over a few days, starting with the involved toes first, then heels, then soles
* unbearable burning, itching, heat
* swollen pain (especially right foot, second toe)
* sensitivity to touch or pressure, especially standing
* exposure to hot water (in a shower) hurt
* once i was able to walk, feet became swollen and hurt after walking
* while i was unable to walk (~3 weeks), alcohol made pain worse (even just one beer)
* advil slightly more helpful than tylenol, but both very limited in any relief
* elevation could help a little bit, but generally not much after the first couple weeks

### Night Attacks
The night attacks I described had these characteristics:
- happen regularly, usually starting 8-830pm, lasting for 1.5-3 hours
- sometimes started earlier, like 5pm, sometimes later, like 10pm
- possible to have a more painful first round and then a second round that would linger while i fell asleep
- pain was so bad i would shout, could not think straight, just had to wait and hold on for it to pass
- best relief was with very cold water epsom salt soaks: with these, i could feel more normal
- about 15 minutes after removing my feet from the cold water bath, as they warmed back up, pain would increase

### Hypotheses
**H1. COVID** - I was infected with COVID on Mar 16th visit to grocery store. My body fought off the infection but did not produce antibodies in levels detectable by the serology test taken Apr 21. COVID toes is pseudo-pernio incited by the virus or my body's response to it.

**H2. Pernio** - I spontaneously contracted pernio without exposure to the cold and without underlying conditions. No COVID.

**H3. Chronic Illness** - An underlying condition, like lupus or diabetes, explains my sudden eruption of pernio. No COVID.

**H4. Something Else** - Something else explains this, but we don't know what.

### My Interpretation
Warning, this is a patient opining about their medical condition. I'm not a doctor. 

My own ranking of the hypotheses is H1 > H4 > H3 ~= H2. I assess H3 and H2 to be roughly equivalent in probability, and both extremely low. 

H2 is limited due to lack of exposure to the cold (my climate is temperate to warm) and my inability to find a recorded case of sponatneous pernio without cold or underlying systemic process. Warm or hot water also hurt, whereas cold water eased, my foot pain.

H3 is limited due to lack of family history, normal ESR test results, and otherwise great health (gym 5x/wk, not obese).

H4 is always possible, but difficult to assign a concrete probability.

H1 appears most credible:
* Symptoms emerge 12 days post exposure, following traditional COVID timelines
* Emerging evidence from [Italy (EJPD Apr 13)](https://www.ejpd.com/images/nuova-vasculite-covid-ENG.pdf), [Spain (BJD Apr 29)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348545), and [American Academy of Dermatology (Medscape May 13)](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/930286) corroborates psuedo-pernio in the age of COVID
* Negative PCR test results are expected 35 days post-exposure. My negative antibody test (IGG/IGM) is more surprising.
* At least [one popular account (May 1)](https://www.businessinsider.com/i-got-coronavirus-antibody-test-heres-what-it-was-like-2020-5) in America, and accounts of dermatologists (including my own) corroborate negative antibody serology with COVID toes in other patients
* [Pre-print from China (medRxiv Apr 20)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v2) suggests recovered patients may not produce antibodies in sufficient levels to be detectable
* Chinese results of 6% (10 of 175, adults, mild no ICU) recovered patients testing negative for antibody serology, if valid, are particularly interesting as they took labratory-confirmed COVID patients and performed the serology post-recovery
